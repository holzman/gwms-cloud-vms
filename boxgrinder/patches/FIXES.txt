BOXGRINDER FIXES

For our purposes, the current version of Boxgrinder has some bugs which need to 
be fixed before use. These have been supplied to the Boxgrinder developers, so 
in theory they should be fixed in the main distribution eventually. 

HOW TO APPLY PATCHES

This patch was generate against boxgrinder version boxgrinder-build-0.10.2-1 on 
FC16. I believe it should work OK against other distros, and probably versions. 
Take a look at the patches--they could easily be applied by hand. 

Apply the patches thus:

BUG DESCRIPTION

Bugs:

-- OS plugin handling of i386/x86-64 dependencies:

/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/boxgrinder-build-0.10.2/lib/boxgrinder-build/plugins/os/rpm-based/rpm-dependency-validator.rb

By default, builds of 64-bit platforms do not include i386 in the package
architecture requested during package installation. This means that there is no
way to request the 64 bit and 32 bit versions of a package. My patch simply adds
i386 to the valid list for 64-bit builds, allowing specification of i386
packages, e.g. lib-foo.i386.


-- EC2 rc local:
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/boxgrinder-build-0.10.2/lib/boxgrinder-build/plugins/platform/ec2/src/rc_local

The rc local template in the EC2 platform plugin was using an old URL for 
UserData runtime contextualization. It was also using curl in an unprotected
fashion, such that it would assume it got valid data whether any had been set or
not. When VMs are run from non-Amazon toolsets, there may not be any keys or
other userdata associated with an instance. My patch confirms that curl returned
successfully, and that the answer is valid.


-- EC2 platform plugin kernel handling:
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/boxgrinder-build-0.10.2/lib/boxgrinder-build/plugins/platform/ec2/ec2-plugin.rb

The EC2 platform plugin removes the standard kernel package and installs the
required kernel-xen package. But when done in this order, other packages that
depend on packagename ‘kernel’ get removed. But they don’t get re-installed
during the xen-kernel install. Simply reversing the order fixes the problem,
since the kernel>=X.Y.Z requirement remains satisfied throughout the sequence of
operations.


-- EC2 platform distribution handling:
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/boxgrinder-build-0.10.2/lib/boxgrinder-build/plugins/platform/ec2/ec2-plugin.rb

The EC2 platform plugin forgot to properly handle SL similarly to RHEL and
CentOS in  the need to explicitly install kernel-xen. A patch adds in that check
so that SL is treated the same.
